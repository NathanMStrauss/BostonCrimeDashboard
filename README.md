# BostonCrimeReport
### This the final project for a DS2000 course at Northeastern University. It is currently in progress.

Given a data set (selected by student groups), create descriptive graphs and generate insights. The students are to explain the topic and why it is significant. To be significant, the project should address some issue or topic that is important scientifically or culturally.

Below is a part of the submitted propoal for the project

> DS2000 Project Proposal: Crime Rates in Boston Dashboard
> 
> Introduction: 
> Our topic focuses on crime incidents in the city of Boston. We chose this topic because of its importance in creating a safe environment for the residents of Boston neighborhoods. Having easy access to information about the frequency, location, and type of crime is vital for the residents of Boston to ensure their own safety. On top of that, exploring crime rates in Boston is significant to the lawmakers and law enforcement in terms of them deciding where reform is needed and where resources can be better allocated.
> 
> Project Goals:  
> For this project, our goals are to visualize different aspects of the crime rates in Boston on a single dashboard. In this dashboard, we hope to create a scatterplot map of the concentration of crimes in order to evaluate which parts of Boston experience the highest crime rates. We also hope to create a visualization of when these crimes are most prevalent (time of day, day of week, month, year, etc.), and use that to compare when crimes are most likely to be violent. 
> For functionality, we hope to build an easy-to-navigate dashboard that enables the user to filter crimes by several different kinds of categories. This includes, but may not be limited to, the following criteria: time of day, day of the week, month, year, location of crime, and type of crime. This dashboard will include a map of boston where all of the filtered data will be displayed, as well as relevant data visualizations (e.g. bar chart, pie graph) of selected criteria.

> Data Sources: 
> The data source that we will be using can be accessed [here](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/crime-incident-reports-august-2015-to-date-source-new-system/resource/313e56df-6d77-49d2-9c49-ee411f10cf58) (or below if the link doesn’t work). It shows the crime incident reports in Boston since August 2015 — 2022. There are over 59,000 data entries and they are provided by the Boston Police Department. The data source includes the following information: the incident number, offense code, offense description districts in Boston, reporting area, shootings, when and where it occurred. In regards to when it happens, the data source provides the specific date and time of when the crime occured so we can use it to create a visualization of when these crimes happen and test our hypothesis. It also provides the longitude and latitude, so we can use that data to create a scatterplot map of where crime is concentrated the most in Boston.
